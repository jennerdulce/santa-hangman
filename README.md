01 Group Final Project

For our final project, our team is making a guessing game called, "Santa-hangman" . This game asking you to create a hidden words using  letters chosen one at a time to create the word. The word is then compared against our pre-assembled list of approved words and a score is generated. If the score makes the high score, your name is entered into the high score list. You then have the opportunity to play again and try to best your high score. Enjoy!
