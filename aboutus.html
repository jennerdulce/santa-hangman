            <h2>About Our project</h2>
              <p1>"There are a lot of things to do, short term and medium term, we have seen a lot of changes not only on the pitch but structurally as a club as well, it's been difficult, it's been a challenging time in the last three or four months, a lot of things have happened. 

                "We have to settle and everyone has to realise where we are now, but I see the future as really bright. I am a really positive person and I tend to learn much more when things don't go well and we have a defeat like we had the other day that really hurt after the performance we had at Old Trafford. 
                
                "We have to understand why it happened, be really critical first of all with myself and try to understand the players better, and give them more solutions to win more football matches."</p1>

              <p>About Ceylin :
                  I am a Air Force Veteran, who previuosly thought Software Development was too hard but always had a interest in it. 
                  I decided to give my technolgy dreams a go.I found Code Fellows and decided to enroll and I love to code now! I've grown more and more fond of Web Development 
                  and the process of figuring out how to make things work.
