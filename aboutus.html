    <h2 id="about2">About Our Project</h2>
    <p id="description">For our final project, our team is making a guessing game called, "Santa-hangman" . This game asking you to create a hidden words using letters chosen one at a time to create the word. The word is then compared against our pre-assembled list of approved words and a score is generated. If the score makes the high score, your name is entered into the high score list. You then have the opportunity to play again and try to best your high score. Enjoy!</p>

      <p class="teamParagraph" id="jennerPara">My name is Jenner Dulce. I'm 27 years old. Right out of high school I served in the Navy as a hospital corpsman(pharmacy technician specifically) for 5 years. Needless to say I was put in a lot of uncomfortable situations/struggles. But through these rough times I was able to grow/mature at a very young age and develop skills which have been refined throughout the years. Skills such as communication, prioritizing, customer/patient care, team work, what hard work really means and patience. Although I lack programming experience, I have 15+ years of computer experience that I have developed while previously being an avid gamer.
        What that being said, being on a computer feels like home to me. Iâ€™ve spent so much time of my life on a
        computer that only makes sense to have a job where I am most comfortable at. I believe that being a programmer
        will provide what I am looking for in a job which is a feeling of purpose by making everyday different and
        exciting. Whether it be at my home or at an office, I feel like I could get the job done. I have a couple
        ofriends that are programmers and I always find myself asking questions to how the code works when they show me
        their projects. The way they explain how code works attracts me more and more. I realize that once you know the
        language will not only make it easier but also more fun.</p>

      <p class="teamParagraph">I am a Air Force Veteran, who previuosly thought Software Development was too hard but always had a interest in it. I decided to give my technolgy dreams a go.I found Code Fellows and decided to enroll and I love to code now! I've grown more and more fond of Web Development and the process of figuring out how to make things work.

      <p class="teamParagraph">about Travis There are a lot of things to do, short term and medium term, we have seen a lot of changes not
      only on the pitch but structurally as a club as well, it's been difficult, it's been a challenging time in the
      last three or four months, a lot of things have happened
      "We have to settle and everyone has to realise where we are now, but I see the future as really bright. I am a
      really positive person and I tend to learn much more when things don't go well and we have a defeat like we had
      the other day that really hurt after the performance we had at Old Trafford.
