    <p id="description">For our final project, our team is making a guessing game called, "Santa-hangman" . This game asking you to create a hidden words using letters chosen one at a time to create the word. The word is then compared against our pre-assembled list of approved words and a score is generated. If the score makes the high score, your name is entered into the high score list. You then have the opportunity to play again and try to best your high score. Enjoy!</p>

      <p class="teamParagraph" id="jennerPara">My name is Jenner Dulce. I'm 27 years old. Right out of high school I served in the Navy as a hospital corpsman(pharmacy technician specifically) for 5 years. Needless to say I was put in a lot of uncomfortable situations/struggles. But through these rough times I was able to grow/mature at a very young age and develop skills which have been refined throughout the years. Skills such as communication, prioritizing, customer/patient care, team work, and patience. Although I lack programming experience, I have 15+ years of computer experience that I have developed while previously being an avid gamer. What that being said, being on a computer feels like home to me. Iâ€™ve spent so much time of my life on a computer that only makes sense to have a job where I am most comfortable at. I believe that being a programmer will provide what I am looking for in a job which is a feeling of purpose by making everyday different and exciting.</p>

      <p class="teamParagraph">Hi, my name is Travis Steed, I am a U.S. veteran orginally from Portland, Indiana and now residing in Des Moines, WA for the time being. I chose to join Code Fellows because I was curious about coding and the different languages. In high school, i took a few classes that was similart to coding but not exactly. I took web design and was on a VEX Robotics team that made it to world finals twice. So i decided i would give actual coding a shot." "Currently I am a diesel technician and now I just got offered the position of being the shop painter, where i would i be giving all of our engines and parts a makeover before they get shipped out.</p>
