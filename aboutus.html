              <p1>"There are a lot of things to do, short term and medium term, we have seen a lot of changes not only on the pitch but structurally as a club as well, it's been difficult, it's been a challenging time in the last three or four months, a lot of things have happened. 

                "We have to settle and everyone has to realise where we are now, but I see the future as really bright. I am a really positive person and I tend to learn much more when things don't go well and we have a defeat like we had the other day that really hurt after the performance we had at Old Trafford. 
                
                "We have to understand why it happened, be really critical first of all with myself and try to understand the players better, and give them more solutions to win more football matches."</p1>

              <p>"Hi, my name is Travis Steed, I am a U.S. veteran orginally from Portland, Indiana and now residing in Des Moines, WA for the time being. I chose to join Code Fellows because I was curious about coding and the different languages. In high school, i took a few classes that was similart to coding but not exactly. I took web design and was on a VEX Robotics team that made it to world finals twice. So i decided i would give actual coding a shot." "Currently I am a diesel technician and now I just got offered the position of being the shop painter, where i would i be giving all of our engines and parts a makeover before they get shipped out."</p>
